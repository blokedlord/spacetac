# UI style guidelines

## Shapes

Main UI shapes are:

* long hexagon
* rectangles, optionally with left and/or right side tilted (if both are tilted, it should be symmetrical)

Buttons should be lit by a pure white line in top-left corner (~75% of the border length)

## Color palette

* First color is for UI
* Second color is for AI
* Third color is for neutral/story
* Fourth color is for highlight
